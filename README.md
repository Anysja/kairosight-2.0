# KairoSight 2.0
Python 3.8 software to analyze analyze time series physiological data of optical action potentials.

This project started as a python port of Camat (cardiac mapping analysis tool) and is inspired by design cues and algorithms from RHYTHM and ImageJ.  
 
I'm currently working on making set up easy through the use of a yml file to create a virtual environment in which KairoSight will run. There are currently some bugs to be worked out. I will update the README with appropriate set up instructions soon.
